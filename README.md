A database project I had for one of my high-level classes.  I find it impressive because I made this entire website in a day as a result of the previous project breaking a day before it was due.  It isn't on the web because my web host account ran out of room.  If one wishes to run it on their own computer, then you need WAMP, you will need to import the database file provided, and to change the DB.php file; change $username to whatever the local username is, and $password to the phpmyAdmin database.
